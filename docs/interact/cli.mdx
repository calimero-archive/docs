Calimero works with all the NEAR tooling including the NEAR CLI. 

You can install the NEAR CLI using: 

```
npm install -g near-cli
```

You can always check your current version by running:

```
near --version  # version info appears on the last line of output
```

:::info
All methods from NEAR CLI are compatible with Calimero Private Shards and the documentation can be found on the official NEAR docs: https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli.
:::


## Requirements

To use NEAR CLI with Calimero you will need to:
- generate an Authentication token on the Security page inside the Calimero Console
- set the custom RPC endpoint for the CLI tool to use from your Dashboard
- set the API token for the CLI to use


## Set API key

Before being able to call this alias, you must set the api key. To use, run the following command:

```
 near set-api-key https://rpc.testnet.near.org <AUTH_TOKEN>   
```

## NEAR state

`near state` shows details of an account's state. To use, run the following command:

```
near state <MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID> --nodeUrl https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/<SHARD_ID>/neard-rpc/ --networkId <SHARD_ID>
```

:::info
More detailed information on this can be found in the [setup near cli](/getting_started/generate_token#set-up-the-near-cli-to-access-the-shard-via-cli) docs.
:::

## RPC Server URL

The RPC server URL allows you to communicate directly with the NEAR network. 

If you are using a mainnet private shard, set the `NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL` environment variable.

Mainet Example :
```bash
export NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL=<put_your_rpc_server_url_here>
near set-api-key $NEAR_CLI_MAINNER_RPC_SERVER_URL <api-key>
```

On the other hand, for testnet use the `NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL` environment variable instead.

Testnet Example :
```bash
export NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL=<put_your_rpc_server_url_here>
near set-api-key $NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL <api-key>
```

## Options
Run `near --help` to see all options

Usage: `near <command> [options]`
