The NEAR RPC API allows you to communicate directly with the NEAR network. For example, tools such as near-api-js are just abstractions making RPC calls.

## Setup
In order to use the RPC API you will need to setup the correct RPC endpoints.

### NEAR RPC endpoint setup
Endpoint URL varies by network:
  - mainnet `https://rpc.mainnet.near.org`
  - testnet `https://rpc.testnet.near.org`
  - localnet `http://localhost:3030`

### Use endpoint to Calimero 
By default NEAR CLI is sending requests to the testnet. We need to use it in Calimero.
