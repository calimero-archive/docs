# Calimero Chat - Community Guidelines

We established Calimero Chat as a platform dedicated to fostering connections among individuals through shared experiences and offering a welcoming space for all. 

Our Community Guidelines serve as the foundation for creating a respectful and inclusive environment, prioritizing the well-being of our users.

These guidelines outline what behavior is not permitted on Calimero Chat. Every user on our platform is expected to adhere to these rules, which apply across all aspects of our service, including user-generated content, conduct, chat rooms, and applications.

Our Trust & Safety team actively reviews reports from users, moderators, and trusted reporters. When someone violates these guidelines, we may take various enforcement actions, including issuing warnings, removing content, suspending or banning accounts and/or chat rooms responsible, and, if necessary, involving law enforcement. We may also consider incidents of off-platform behavior when assessing potential violations of these Community Guidelines.

If you come across a user, message, or chat room that appears to breach these guidelines, please report it to us.
