The prover enables us to build a set of contracts for transferring assets from one chain to another. Calimero supports transfering Fungible tokens as well as Non Fungible tokens from one chain to another. Also, via the Calimero bridge cross shard calls can be executed.

In next sections we describe how the Fungible, Nonfungible and Cross shard calls connectors work.
