The Light Client Contract plays a crucial role in enabling interoperability between the NEAR mainnet and Calimero shard. It provides implementations of the NEAR light client as a contract, allowing for the relay of block headers and validation of their authenticity. There are two possible scenarios where the Light Client Contract is utilized: bridging from the NEAR mainnet to the Calimero shard or bridging between Calimero shards for various use cases.

## Validation Criteria for Block Headers

The Light Client Contract imposes specific validation criteria on the relayed block headers. Notably, each valid block header must contain at least two-thirds of the valid signatures from the epoch block producers. This ensures the integrity and trustworthiness of the relayed headers. The contract doesn't need to verify every block header in the chain's history. Instead, it requires at least one verified block header per epoch. This approach balances efficiency with security.

## Efficient Verification of Events

A notable advantage of the Light Client Contract is its ability to efficiently verify events that occurred in previous headers. This is possible due to the presence of a Merkle tree root in every NEAR header, which is computed from all headers before it. With just one NEAR header, the contract can efficiently verify any event that occurred in any previous header.

## Head Update Conditions

The Light Client Contract updates its head based on the information from the `LightClientBlockView` if the following conditions are met:

- The height of the block is higher than the height of the current head.
- The epoch of the block is equal to the `epoch_id` or `next_epoch_id` known for the current head.
- If the epoch of the block is equal to the `next_epoch_id` of the head, then `next_bps` (next block producers) is not None. Additionally, `approvals_after_next` must contain valid signatures on the `approval_message` from the block producers of the corresponding epoch.
- The signatures present in `approvals_after_next` correspond to more than two-thirds of the total stake.
- If `next_bps` is not None, `sha256(borsh(next_bps))` corresponds to the `next_bp_hash` in `inner_lite`.

## Considerations for Calimero on NEAR Light Client

For the Calimero on the NEAR light client, there is a limitation due to NEAR's transaction gas limit of 300 Tgas per transaction. Since signature verifications are computationally expensive, performing a large number of signature checks (approximately 50) can exceed this limit and cause transaction failures. However, there is good news on the horizon. [NEP364](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/7567) is currently in progress, which aims to add `ed25519_verify` as a precompiled function in the NEAR runtime. Once implemented, this precompiled function will allow the efficient verification of up to 100 validator signatures on every relayed block.

## Gas Cost Considerations for NEAR on Calimero Light Client

In contrast, the signature verification cost is not a significant concern for the NEAR on the Calimero light client contract. The shard creator has the ability to set up the genesis block in such a way that the gas costs are cheaper, ensuring that the signature verification process remains within acceptable limits. This provides flexibility in managing gas costs for signature verification in the context of NEAR on Calimero.
