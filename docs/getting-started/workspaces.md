This guide will walk you through the process of creating workspaces within an organization. Workspaces are essential for managing different aspects of your projects, and they can be set up in various configurations based on your requirements.

## Understanding Workspaces

In the Calimero Network Console, a workspace belongs to a single organization. Each workspace represents a distinct environment where you can set up your blockchain projects. Here's a breakdown of the available workspaces:

- **Developer Workspace**: This workspace is designed for your development needs.
- **Professional Workspace**: This workspace offers options for mainnet and testnet deployments.

## Creating a Professional Mainnet Workspace

For a professional workspace with mainnet deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Select Workspace Type**: Choose the "Professional Workspace" option.

2. **Mainnet Workspace**: Opt for the "Mainnet" environment if your smart contracts and applications are production-ready.

Setting up workspaces within your organization allows you to tailor your blockchain environment to suit your specific needs.


## Configure Testnet

You'l need tto select the number of
- validator nodes: They are running the consensus algorithm where they calculate the value of transactions
- RPC nodes: They allow you to communicate directly with Calimero Shard
- Archive rpc nodes: They hold all historical transaction  and state. They allow you to communicate directly with Calimero Shard
- Indexer nodes: They are used for storing hisotircal data
