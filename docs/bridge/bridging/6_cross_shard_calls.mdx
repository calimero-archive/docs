title: How to make cross-shard contract calls
sidebar_position: 6

Cross-shard contract calls can be executed via the Calimero bridge, allowing contracts on Calimero and NEAR to interact with each other through callbacks.

## Example: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

An example DApp deployed on the NEAR testnet demonstrates cross-shard calls between Calimero and NEAR. The Tic-Tac-Toe game contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples/tree/master/tic-tac-toe/contracts).

### Game Registration

To initiate a game on Calimero, both players need to register on the NEAR testnet contract. The following commands register two players for the game:

```bash
near call tictactoe.igi.testnet register_player --accountId igi.testnet
near call tictactoe.igi.testnet register_player --accountId mikimaus.testnet
```

Players registered for the game: [playerA](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/7TscAyfni781qz2vgpeKXTR2Bc8JRXaeftjK1SHJHMNc) and [playerB](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/8Ex1pojKw8fp5Y8X85gy5fTX9VyWrC4VUHCTvNR1kArT).

### Starting the Game

Once the second player registers, a `CALIMERO_EVENT_CROSS_CALL` event is emitted, transmitting the arguments required to call the Calimero shard and start the game. The bridge service receives this event and attempts to prove on the cross-shard connector on Calimero that a Tic-Tac-Toe game needs to start. If the proof is successful, the `start_game` method is called on the Tic-Tac-Toe contract on Calimero. Subsequently, a `CALIMERO_EVENT_CROSS_RESPONSE` event is emitted from the cross-shard connector on Calimero. Upon successful proof on NEAR, the callback method `game_started` is executed. You can view the transaction showing the [executed callback](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/DWyCptftairNMtryiikSkWRVadeqSRN8CEgC1eEAZahL).

### Game Completion

Similarly, you can observe how the `game_ended` method was called from Calimero to NEAR testnet [here](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/FkE4dEHzbJ5tZKdrYC3QYbpWf5dGVgsqbqVwb12wUp1z).

### Viewing the Final Game Result

To view the final game result on NEAR testnet, use the following command:

```bash
near view tictactoe.igi.testnet get_finished_game --args '{"game_id":0}'
```

This command retrieves the details of the finished game, including the game board, the players, the game status, and whose turn it is.

Example Result:
```bash
{
  board: [ [ 'O', 'X', 'X' ], [ 'O', 'U', 'U' ], [ 'O', 'U', 'U' ] ],
  player_a: 'igi.testnet',
  player_b: 'igi.testnet',
  status: 'PlayerAWon',
  player_a_turn: false
}
```

By following these steps, you can see how cross-shard contract calls are made and the game progresses between Calimero and NEAR in the Tic-Tac-Toe example.
