We've leveraged the power of the NEAR Protocol and the Blockchain Operating System (BOS) to create this  Calimero portal.  With Calimero, you get a private space online where you're in control.  It comes equipped with a range of open-source apps that you can customize and manage according to your needs. They offer the familiarity of the software services you're accustomed to, but with enhanced benefits like security and true ownership. Calimero and the Open Web offer a pathway to this new era of digital ownership. Dive into a digital realm where privacy isn't a luxury—it’s a right. 

## Our Vision

The Community Shard was developed with a specific intent: to champion the growth of Open Web applications, not to compete with public BOS. Certain applications, like chats or HR systems, are optimized for a private setting, and Calimero provides that environment.

## How the Community Shard Operate
The Community Shard stand out due to the following reasons: 

### Collective Ownership

Community shards operate on a unique model of collective ownership. Multiple companies come together to co-own and jointly maintain these shards. 

### Inclusive Accessibility

Community shards are intentionally designed to be fully accessible to the public. They are open to a wide array of users, including members of the Beta Tester group. This open-door policy fosters inclusivity and actively nurtures the development of public communities. Users are welcome to participate in public discussions, interact with one another, and conduct transactions without any financial barriers.

### Decentralized Data Hosting

Participating companies can host data required for their community shard applications. Each company's contribution to data hosting collectively support the shard's integrity and reliability.

### Tailored Flexibility

Calimero acknowledges that diverse communities possess unique needs and preferences. As a result, the system offers tailored flexibility for communities that aspire to have their dedicated community shards. This customization empowers communities to curate an environment that aligns precisely with their specific requirements.

### Seamless Data Migration

A standout advantage of community shards is the seamless data migration feature. As long as at least one entity within the shard operates with honesty and transparency, users can confidently migrate their data from old shards to new ones. This feature ensures data continuity and minimizes disruptions during transitions.
