To add your public key you'll need your Private shard custodian account.  If your shard name is 'demos-calimero-testnet', your custodian account name is 'demos.calimero.testnet'.

To access your account ID, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Calimero [Console](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard).
2. Click on the Security dropdown in the left navigation menu.
3. Select **Custodian**.
By default Calimero creates an custodian account for you but you can go ahead and create your own by clicking on **Add an account**.
