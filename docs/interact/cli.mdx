Calimero works seamlessly with all NEAR tooling, including the NEAR CLI. To get started, follow these steps:

## Installation

Install the NEAR CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

To verify the installation and check the current version, use the following command:

```bash
near --version
```

You can find detailed documentation on using the NEAR CLI with Calimero Private Shards on the official NEAR docs: [https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli).

## Requirements

To use the NEAR CLI with Calimero, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Generate an authentication token on the Security page inside the Calimero Console.
- Set the custom RPC endpoint for the CLI tool to use from your Dashboard.
- Set the API token for the CLI to use.

## Set up the NEAR CLI to access the Shard via CLI

To interact with the Calimero shard using `near-cli`, you need to set the token value using the `near set-api-key` command. Run the following command, replacing `<AUTH_TOKEN>` with your token value:

```bash
near set-api-key https://rpc.testnet.near.org <AUTH_TOKEN>
```

Please note that the value `https://rpc.testnet.near.org` is currently ignored by the CLI. However, this issue will be fixed and released in the next version of the CLI.

### Verify the NEAR state

To verify the setup, first set your variables:

```bash
export MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID="<YOUR_MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID>"
export SHARD_RPC_URL="<YOUR_SHARD_RPC_URL>"
export SHARD_ID="<YOUR_SHARD_ID>"
```

Replace `<YOUR_MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID>` with your actual main account ID on the Calimero shard.
Replace `<YOUR_SHARD_RPC_URL>` with the URL of the shard's RPC node.
Replace `<YOUR_SHARD_ID>` with the ID of your Calimero shard.

After exporting these parameters, you can use them in the `near state` command as follows:

```bash
near state $MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID.calimero.testnet --nodeUrl $SHARD_RPC_URL --networkId $SHARD_ID-calimero-testnet
```

Here is an example:

```bash
near state demo.calimero.testnet --nodeUrl https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/demo-calimero-testnet/neard-rpc/ --networkId demo-calimero-testnet
```

## Interacting with the RPC Server URL

The RPC server allows direct communication with the NEAR network. By default, the NEAR CLI sends requests to the testnet at [https://rpc.testnet.near.org](https://rpc.testnet.near.org).

To interact with the Calimero shard, you need to use the URL of the shard's RPC node: [https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/demo-calimero-testnet/neard-rpc/](https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/demo-calimero-testnet/neard-rpc/).

### Options

You can run `near --help` to see all available options.

### Alias

To simplify the usage of the NEAR CLI with Calimero, you can define a shell alias. Here's an example for defining an alias in `zsh`:

```bash
alias calimero='calimero_wrapper() {
    local command="$1";
    local max_gas="300000000000000";
    local node_url=SHARD_RPC_URL";
    local network_id="SHARD_ID";
    local args=();

    if [[ "$command" == "call" ]]; then
        args=("$@");
        near "${args[@]}" --gas $max_gas --nodeUrl "$node_url" --networkId

 "$network_id";
    else
        args=("$@");
        near "${args[@]}" --nodeUrl "$node_url" --networkId "$network_id";
    fi
}; calimero_wrapper'
```

With the alias defined, you can now use the NEAR CLI with Calimero. For example:

```bash
calimero state demo.calimero.testnet
```
