# Private Shard
A Calimero Private Shard is a **customizable sidechain built on top of NEAR Protocol**. Private shards are independent networks and do not share validators, execution and state storage. NEAR Protocol is a blockchain that has been built from the ground up to be high-performant, incredibly secure, and infinitely scalable all while supporting sustainability and Calimero Shards share all the benefits.

Calimero shards support three main modes of operation:
- Permissioned Private Calimero Shard owned by a single entity
- Permissioned Private Calimero Shard owned by a consortium 
- Public Calimero Shard owned by a community

Calimero shards can support up to 200k transactions per second, but a standard one shard deployment has the throughput of 5k transactions per second.


# Features
Interoperate with open source protocols and applications to enhance your application, from DeFi to NFTs.

Swap your assets between private chains and other public blockchains seamlessly. 

With Calimero, you can perform cross-shard transactions, which allow you to interact with other third parties on the public chain or other permissioned enterprise shards. 


Smart contracts from private shards can call into public shard to interact with those applications  

Public smart contracts if setup can also call into private shardâ€™s contracts (extended trust model, similar to Oracles)

An encrypted channel can be used for private shards to interact with each other. 


# Benefits of using a Private Shard


Interoperability between the private shard and public networks out of the box
