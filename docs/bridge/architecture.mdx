The NEAR to Calimero bridge enables users to move assets between NEAR public networks (Testnet or Mainnet) and your private shard. Additionally, you can execute cross-shard contract calls, which include private smart contract calls inside the shard from a public contract or public smart contract calls from a contract inside the private shard.
