The Indexer API allows you to interact with the Calimero shard's indexer service to fetch data about accounts, transactions, and other blockchain-related information. Here's a guide on how to use the Indexer API:

## Prerequisites
Before using the Indexer API, ensure you have access to the Calimero console.

## Configuration
To make calls to the Indexer API, you need to configure the following parameters:

### Endpoint
The API endpoint is constructed using the following parts:
- `networkId`: This can be either **testnet** (with the suffix: **-calimero-testnet**) or **mainnet** (with the suffix: **-calimero**).
- `shardId`: This is the unique identifier of your shard and consists of the user-defined shard name and network suffix. All parts are required.
The endpoint URL is as follows:

```
https://api.{{networkId}}.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/{{shardId}}/indexer-graphql/graphql
```
You can find the endpoint URL in the [Calimero Console](/interact/endpoints).

### Authorization Token
Follow the steps provided [here](https://docs.calimero.network/interact/cli#set-up-the-near-cli-to-access-the-shard-via-cli) to generate an auth token for your Calimero shard.

The authorization token must be provided in the header of your API request:

```javascript
Authorization: {{token}}
```

The Indexer API schema is available [here](https://github.com/community/community/files/10108266/schema.txt).

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to make a request to the Indexer API using different tools:

### Postman
- **Method:** POST
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `networkId`: testnet
  - `shardId`: test-calimero-testnet (make sure to include the complete shard ID)

  ```
  https://api.testnet.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/test-calimero-testnet/indexer-graphql/graphql
  ```
- **Headers:**
  - Include the `Authorization` header with the value of the token generated in the previous step.
- **Body:**
  - A GraphQL query.
- **Query:**
  ```graphql
  query accounts{
      allAccounts{
          totalCount
      }
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  - If the API call is correct, a status 200 will be returned with the response body:
  ```json
  {
      "data": {
          "allAccounts": {
              "totalCount": 4
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Apollo Studio

With these examples, you can start using the Indexer API to fetch data from the Calimero shard's indexer service.
