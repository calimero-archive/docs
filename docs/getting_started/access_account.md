In custodial accounts, we only display those accounts for which the Calimero platform is the custodian. With your custodian account, you can create a key pair, add public keys and top up your tokens.

To access your custodial account, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Calimero [Console](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard).
2. Click on the Security dropdown in the left navigation menu.
3. Select **Custodial**.

By default Calimero creates an custodial account for you but you can go ahead and create your own by clicking on **Add an account**.
