The Community Shard is a unique and exclusive private shard powered by the latest nearcore version. It operates in close collaboration with key players from the NEAR ecosystem and is designed to support the use of BOS components while showcasing examples of Open Web applications. These applications can be utilized as-is or customized to meet the specific needs of individual companies within their private setups.

## Our Vision

Our primary goal in establishing the Community Shard is not to compete with the public BOS. Instead, it serves as an exclusive hub entirely dedicated to the development of Open Web applications. Certain applications, such as chats, project management tools, HR systems, forms, and docs, are better suited for operation within a private environment. Calimero provides this private environment to ensure their optimal functionality.

## How the Community Shards Operate

### Collective Ownership

Community shards operate on a unique model of collective ownership. Multiple companies come together to co-own and jointly maintain these shards. 

### Inclusive Accessibility

Community shards are intentionally designed to be fully accessible to the public. They are open to a wide array of users, including members of the Beta Tester group. This open-door policy fosters inclusivity and actively nurtures the development of public communities. Users are welcome to participate in public discussions, interact with one another, and conduct transactions without any financial barriers.

### Decentralized Data Hosting

Participating companies can host data required for their community shard applications. Each company's contribution to data hosting collectively support the shard's integrity and reliability.

### Tailored Flexibility

Calimero acknowledges that diverse communities possess unique needs and preferences. As a result, the system offers tailored flexibility for communities that aspire to have their dedicated community shards. This customization empowers communities to curate an environment that aligns precisely with their specific requirements.

### Seamless Data Migration

A standout advantage of community shards is the seamless data migration feature. As long as at least one entity within the shard operates with honesty and transparency, users can confidently migrate their data from old shards to new ones. This feature ensures data continuity and minimizes disruptions during transitions.

## Participation Requirements

To become part of the community shard ecosystem, companies are required to:

- Believe in the idea of the Open Web and be open to experiments.
- Be an active company in the NEAR ecosystem.
- Create a Calimero account (takes about one minute to create).
