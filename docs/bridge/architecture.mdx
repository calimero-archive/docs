## Overview

The Calimero Bridge handles the transfer of various assets, including fungible and non-fungible tokens, between NEAR public networks (Testnet or Mainnet) and Calimero private shard. It also facilitates cross-shard contract calls, enabling interactions between public and private smart contracts.

Below is a high-level overview of the bridge's components:

## Key Components

The architecture of the NEAR to Calimero bridge includes the following key components:

### Light Client Contract

The Light Client contract validates and accepts block headers that meet specific validation criteria, ensuring the integrity and security of the bridge's operations.

### Prover Contract

The Prover contract proves that a transaction occurred on the opposite chain (for example on the Near side if this Prover contract is on the Calimero side). It asks light client contract for the Merkle tree root for the specific block height, and he uses this information for the verification of the proof

### Connector Contracts

The Connector Contracts handle the transfer of specific asset types:

- FT Connector: Facilitates the transfer of fungible tokens (FT) between NEAR public networks (Testnet or Mainnet) and Calimero private shard.
- NFT Connector: Handles the transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFT) between NEAR public networks (Testnet or Mainnet) and Calimero private shard.
- Cross-shard Contract Calls Connector: handles contract pair used to call one chain's contract methods from another chain.

### Archival Node
The Archival Node stores all past transactions, typically spanning a longer time period (e.g., a month or week ago). It serves as a historical record of transaction data.

### Indexer
The Indexer fetches blockchain data and stores it in a database, allowing for efficient retrieval and querying of transaction information.

### Relayer
The Relayer consumes messages from the message queue and relays a new light client block header to the opposite side.

### Message Queue
The Message Queue is used for communication of events indexer on one side and bridge and relayer service on the other sid

### Bridge Service
The Bridge Service receives the block where a Calimero event occurred (lock, burn or cross shard calls related events)
