Here we will show how to bridge fungible tokens from NEAR Testnet to Calimero and withdraw the tokens back to NEAR Testnet.
In order for bridging to work, see previous section on the prerequisites.

## Bridging FTs from NEAR to Calimero

### Send FTs to ft_connector on NEAR

With the fungible token connector ft's can be bridged from NEAR to Calimero and back. In order to bridge some ft from NEAR testnet to Calimero, a single transaction needs to be called. Just lock the wanted amount of tokens to the ft connector contract. Once they are transferred, the bridge service and the relayer will be notified about it and try to prove on the Calimero shard that the locking of tokens happened on NEAR. If proved, wrapped tokens are minted on Calimero shard.

This is the only transaction from user/dapp input that needs to happen in order to bridge the tokens.

:::caution
When locking FTs on source side FT Connector you **MUST** do it through **ft_transfer_call**. If you try to do it through ** ft_transfer ** tokens will be **LOST**.

### CLI command

Example of locking fungible tokens on NEAR testnet with [transaction on NEAR testnet](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/FAGjdTYkHJ2bdWP9CRznzxj7kB3KXRfNDw3hsdUGdFZX):
``` bash
near call wrap.testnet ft_transfer_call --args '{"receiver_id":"ft_connector.cali99.dev.calimero.testnet","amount":"12345","msg":""}' --accountId igi.testnet --depositYocto 1 --gas 3000000000000
```

### JS

For a fully working example check out this repo: https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples/tree/master/bridging-fts

Here is a short snippet:

``` js
const callFtTransferCallOnSource: FunctionCallOptions = {
  contractId: 'wrap.testnet',
  methodName: 'ft_transfer_call',
  args: {
    receiver_id: ftConnectorOnNearContractId,
    amount: amount,
    msg: 'testnet',
  },
  attachedDeposit: new big.BN('1'),
  gas: new big.BN(MAX_GAS_LIMIT),
};

const transferTokensTx = await senderAccount.functionCall(callFtTransferCallOnSource);
```

## Withdraw FTs back to NEAR

### Burn FTs on Calimero

If the users want to get the tokens back on the original chain (in this case NEAR testnet), they simply call withdraw on the bridged token on the other chain (in this case Calimero shard) which will essentially burn tokens. The bridge service will be notified via emitted event that a burn happened and try to prove on the ft connector contract on NEAR that a burn happaned on Calimero shard. If proved, tokens are unlocked.

### Helper cli
For Calimero side create Calimero alias (change `dev` to `staging` for staging and remove it for production):
```
alias calimero='function x() { near ${@:2} --nodeUrl https://api.dev.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/$1/neard-rpc --networkId $1;} ; x'
```

### CLI command

Example of withdrawing/burning tokens on Calimero with [transaction on NEAR testnet](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/5hnG8P52BrGVeuPR37nHvHz2SKtQabDKyC2yuQmfe34C):
```
calimero cali99-calimero-testnet call wrap.ft_deployer.cali99.calimero.testnet withdraw --args '{"amount":"345"}' --accountId igi.testnet --depositYocto 1 --gas 300000000000000
```

### JS

For a fully working example check out this repo: https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples/tree/master/bridging-fts

Here is a short snippet:

``` js
const callWithdrawOnCalimero: FunctionCallOptions = {
  contractId: 'wrap.ft_deployer.cali99.calimero.testnet',
  methodName: 'withdraw',
  args: {
    amount: amount,
  },
  attachedDeposit: new big.BN('1'),
  gas: new big.BN(MAX_GAS_LIMIT),
};

const withdrawTokensTx = await senderAccount.functionCall(callWithdrawOnCalimero);
```

### Recap

We have transferred wrap fungible tokens from NEAR testnet to a Calimero shard called cali99. We did this by locking the wNEAR coins on the source ft_connector contract. This will emit an event that the tokens were locked. The tesntet to calimero relayer will pick up this event and relay a block from Near testnet to Calimero shard. Also, the bridge service will pick up this event and try to prove on Calimero that the locking of tokens actually happened on Near testnet. If proved, wNEAR will be minted on Calimero.
Also, we have witdrawn wNEAR back to Near testnet. We did this by calling withdraw on the FT token contract on Calimero, which will essentially burn the requested amount of tokens. Once this happens the Calimero to Testnet relayer will be notified about the burn event, and will relay a block from Calimero to testnet. Also, the bridge service will pick up this event and try to prove on Testnet that the amount was burnt on Calimero. If proved, the tokens are released back on the Near testnet.

## Checking for FT balance

Here are the CLI commands to read fungible token balanace on both NEAR and Calimero:

NEAR:
``` bash
near view wrap.testnet ft_balance_of --args '{"account_id":"igi.testnet"}'
```

Calimero:
``` bash
calimero cali99-calimero-testnet view wrap.ft_deployer.cali99.calimero.testnet ft_balance_of --args '{"account_id":"igi.testnet"}'
```
