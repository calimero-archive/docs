Calimero works with all the NEAR tooling including the NEAR CLI.

You can install the NEAR CLI using: 
```
npm install -g near-cli
```

All methods from NEAR CLI are compatible with Calimero and the documentation can be found on the official NEAR docs: https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli.


To use NEAR CLI with Calimero SDK you will need to:
- generate an Authentication token through the Calimero Dashboard
- set the custom RPC endpoint for the CLI tool to use
- set the API token for the CLI to use

NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL
NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL

```
export NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL=<put_your_rpc_server_url_here>
```


```
near set-api-key <rpc-server-url> <api-key>
```
