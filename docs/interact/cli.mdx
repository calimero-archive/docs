Calimero works with all the NEAR tooling including the NEAR CLI.

You can install the NEAR CLI using: 
```
npm install -g near-cli
```

All methods from NEAR CLI are compatible with Calimero Private Shards and the documentation can be found on the official NEAR docs: https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli.


To use NEAR CLI with Calimero SDK you will need to:
- generate an Authentication token on the Security page inside the Calimero Console
- set the custom RPC endpoint for the CLI tool to use from your Dashboard
- set the API token for the CLI to use


In case you are using a mainnet private shard, set the NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL environment variable. On the other hand, for testnet use the
NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL environment variable instead.


Mainet Example :
```bash
export NEAR_CLI_MAINNET_RPC_SERVER_URL=<put_your_rpc_server_url_here>
near set-api-key $NEAR_CLI_MAINNER_RPC_SERVER_URL <api-key>
```

Testnet Example :
```bash
export NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL=<put_your_rpc_server_url_here>
near set-api-key $NEAR_CLI_TESTNET_RPC_SERVER_URL <api-key>
```
