A relayer receives blocks from a source chain and sends them to a light client contract on a destination chain, establishing a bidirectional bridge between the chains/shards. In order to accomplish this, light client contracts must exist on both chains/shards.

The LightClientBlockView structure is being relayed here. Here is a code sample of the structure together with its substructs:

```rust
pub struct LightClientBlockView {
    pub prev_block_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub next_block_inner_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub inner_lite: BlockHeaderInnerLiteView,
    pub inner_rest_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub next_bps: Option<Vec<ValidatorStakeView>>,
    pub approvals_after_next: Vec<Option<Signature>>,
}
```

```rust
pub struct BlockHeaderInnerLiteView {
    pub height: BlockHeight,
    pub epoch_id: CryptoHash,
    pub next_epoch_id: CryptoHash,
    pub prev_state_root: CryptoHash,
    pub outcome_root: CryptoHash,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub next_bp_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub block_merkle_root: CryptoHash,
}
```

```rust
pub enum ApprovalInner {
    Endorsement(CryptoHash),
    Skip(BlockHeight)
}
```

```rust
pub struct ValidatorStakeView {
    pub account_id: AccountId,
    pub public_key: PublicKey,
    pub stake: Balance,
}
```

```rust
pub struct LightClientBlockLiteView {
    pub prev_block_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub inner_rest_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub inner_lite: BlockHeaderInnerLiteView,
}
```
