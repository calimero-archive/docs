title: How to build a Tic Tac Toe game on Calimero
sidebar_position: 1
---

This beginner tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a Tic Tac Toe decentralized application (dApp) using the Calimero network. You'll learn how to set up your environment, build a smart contract, deploy it to the Calimero shard, and interact with the dApp.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Set up your [Calimero private shard](https://docs.calimero.network/getting_started/set_shard).
- Install a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Install the [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli#setup) tool.
- Install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) on your machine.
- Set up the Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) toolchain. 

## Step 1: Build the Smart Contract

1. Clone the [Calimero examples repository](https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples) by running the following command in your terminal:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples
```

2. Navigate to the `tic-tac-toe` folder and then the `contracts/calimero-tictactoe` directory:

```bash
cd calimero-examples/tic-tac-toe/contracts/calimero-tictactoe
```

3. Compile the Rust smart contract to WebAssembly (WASM) by running the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```
Once the compilation is complete, you'll find the compiled `.wasm` file of the contract at: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/tictactoe.wasm`.

## Step 2: Generate an Auth Token

Before deploying the Tic Tac Toe game, you need to generate a Calimero auth token. This token will authenticate and authorize external applications to communicate with your shard.

Follow the steps provided [here](/docs/getting_started/generate_token.md) to generate an auth token for your Calimero shard.

## Step 3: Set up the NEAR CLI

To interact with your Calimero shard using NEAR CLI, you need to set the token value using the `near set-api-key` command.

Follow the steps provided [here](/interact/cli#set-up-the-near-cli-to-access-the-shard-via-cli) to set up the NEAR CLI.


## Step 4: Create a Keypair

A keypair for a shard account consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. To generate a new keypair for the shard account, follow these steps:

1. Set the SHARD_ID environment variable in your command-line interface:

```bash
export SHARD_ID="your_shard_name"
```

Make sure to replace **"your_shard_name"** with the name of your shard.

2. Run the `near generate-key` command to generate a key for your shard:

```bash
near generate-key $SHARD_ID.calimero.testnet --networkId $SHARD_ID-calimero-testnet
```

3. Navigate to the `~/.near-credentials/` folder to locate the generated keypair file in `.json` format. Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/.near-credentials/network-id/account-id.json
```

:::info
Take note of the **account_id**, **private_key**, and **public_key** values from the **.json** file.
:::

## Step 5: Create a Sub Account

Create a sub account that will be used to deploy the previously built contract. This sub account should be created from the [Custodial account](https://docs.calimero.network/getting_started/custodial#create-custodial-account) in the Calimero Console, and the public key obtained from the generated keypair should be added to the sub account.

Follow the steps [here](https://docs.calimero.network/getting_started/custodial#custodial-account) to set up the sub account and add the public key.

## Step 6: Deploy Your NEAR Contract

To deploy your contract to the private shard, follow these steps:

1. In your cloned repository's directory, open the `deploy_calimero.sh` file. You'll see this command:

```bash
near deploy \
  --accountId "tictactoe.$destination_master_account" \
  --initFunction new --initArgs {} \
  --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/tic_tac_toe.wasm \
  --nodeUrl "https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/$shard_id-calimero-testnet/neard-rpc/" \
  --networkId "$shard_id-calimero-testnet"
```

2. Set the SHARD_ID environment variable in your command-line interface:

```bash
export SHARD_ID="your_shard_name"
```

Make sure to replace **"your_shard_name"** with the name of your shard.

3. Run the following command in your terminal to deploy the contract:

```bash
./deploy_calimero.sh $SHARD_ID
```

This command will deploy the application to the NEAR contract using the provided parameters.

You can check the deployed contract on the [Explorer > Transactions](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard/explorer/transactions) page.

![Explorer](https://github.com/calimero-is-near/docs/assets/39309699/e63ce36b-bb48-4d82-8bb5-5da82a25c703/)

## Step 7: Set up Environment Variables

Navigate to the `ui` folder in the repository. Open the `.env.local` file and adjust the environment variables based on your setup:

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_SHARD_ID**: Your Calimero shard ID.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_URL**: Link to testnet myNearWallet
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CALMERA_URL**: RPC endpoint obtained from the Calimero Console dashboard.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CALMERA_TOKEN**: Auth token you generated earlier from the console.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID**: Your sub account located under the custodial account.
