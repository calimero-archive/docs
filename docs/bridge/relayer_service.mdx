Relayer reads blocks from a source chain and sends the block headers to the light client contract on the destination chain. To have a bidirectional bridge, block headers need to be relayed both ways, meaning that light client contracts need to exist on both chains/shards.

LightClientBlockView is the struct that is being relayed. Here is how it looks together with the substructs:

```
pub struct LightClientBlockView {
    pub prev_block_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub next_block_inner_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub inner_lite: BlockHeaderInnerLiteView,
    pub inner_rest_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub next_bps: Option<Vec<ValidatorStakeView>>,
    pub approvals_after_next: Vec<Option<Signature>>,
}
```

```
pub struct BlockHeaderInnerLiteView {
    pub height: BlockHeight,
    pub epoch_id: CryptoHash,
    pub next_epoch_id: CryptoHash,
    pub prev_state_root: CryptoHash,
    pub outcome_root: CryptoHash,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub next_bp_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub block_merkle_root: CryptoHash,
}
```

```
pub enum ApprovalInner {
    Endorsement(CryptoHash),
    Skip(BlockHeight)
}
```

```
pub struct ValidatorStakeView {
    pub account_id: AccountId,
    pub public_key: PublicKey,
    pub stake: Balance,
}
```

```
pub struct LightClientBlockLiteView {
    pub prev_block_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub inner_rest_hash: CryptoHash,
    pub inner_lite: BlockHeaderInnerLiteView,
}
```
