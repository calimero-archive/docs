To establish a bridge between NEAR Testnet and a Calimero shard, you can follow these manual installation steps. However, for a more streamlined process, you can utilize the Calimero Console tool, which automates the setup. For assistance with automated setup, please reach out to us via our [contact page](https://www.calimero.network/contact) or by sending an [email](mailto:info@calimero.network).

## Set up the Bridge

Follow these steps to set up the bridge:

1. Deploy and initialize the light client contract on NEAR Testnet.
2. Deploy and initialize the prover contract on NEAR Testnet.
3. Start the Calimero-to-NEAR Testnet relayer and keep it running continuously.
4. Deploy and initialize the light client contract on Calimero.
5. Deploy and initialize the prover contract on Calimero.
6. Start the NEAR Testnet-to-Calimero relayer and keep it running continuously.

You can execute steps 1-3 and steps 4-6 simultaneously to expedite the setup process.

## Deploying the Connectors

Here are the steps to deploy the FT connectors. The process for NFT and cross-shard call connectors is similar:

1. Deploy and initialize the FT connector on NEAR Testnet.
2. Deploy and initialize the FT connector on Calimero.
3. Call the `set_locker` function on the FT connector contract on both NEAR Testnet and Calimero.
4. Start the bridge service and ensure it remains operational.

## Transferring Tokens

Before transferring tokens from the source chain to the destination chain, you need to register the fungible token with the FT connector contract account ID on the source chain. In most cases, this involves calling `storage_deposit` before interacting with the specific fungible token. However, please note that not all fungible tokens require this step. For instance, USN does not require it.

Once the FT connector is registered with the fungible token, anyone can initiate token transfers from the source chain to the destination chain and withdraw tokens back from the destination chain to the source chain. The steps involved in initiating a transfer on either side are described in detail in the Fungible Token Connector section.
