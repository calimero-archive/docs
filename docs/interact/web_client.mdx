### Create a new Private Shard API key

- Generate a new token in the Calimero console dashboard. Follow the steps provided [here](https://docs.calimero.network/console/generate_token).
- Copy your API key somewhere safe for security reasons. The API key will only be shown to you once. Make sure to store it securely, as it cannot be retrieved or restored.

## Initialize the connection with the private shard

Create a new `ConnectConfig` with the following parameters and initialize the connection.

* nodeUrl: The JSON RPC url. It can be obtained from the Calimero dashboard and it follows the pattern https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/${shardId}/neard-rpc/

* token: The token generated in the previous step

* shardId: The identificator of the shard is passed as the network ID to the Near Connection

```js
const connectionConfig = {
  networkId: shardId,
  keyStore: myKeyStore,
  nodeUrl: "https://api-testnet.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/xabi/neard-rpc/",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key" : TOKEN
  }
};

const near = await connect({ ...config, keyStore });
```
