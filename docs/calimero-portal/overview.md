We've leveraged the power of the NEAR Protocol and the Blockchain Operating System (BOS) to create this  Calimero portal. Calimero provides a private online space equipped with a suite of open-source applications. These apps deliver the functionality of popular software services but with added security and genuine data ownership. With Calimero, users step into a new era of digital ownership where privacy is a fundamental right.

The Community Shard is a dedicated private shard, optimized for BOS components. It showcases the potential of Open Web applications. These applications can be adopted as provided or customized to fit specific enterprise needs.

## Our Vision

The Community Shard was developed with a specific intent: to champion the growth of Open Web applications, not to compete with public BOS. Certain applications, like chats or HR systems, are optimized for a private setting, and Calimero provides that environment.

## How does the Community Shard Operate
The Community Shard stand out due to the following: 

### Collective Ownership

Community shards are co-owned and jointly maintained by multiple companies.

### Open Accessibility

Community shards are open to all, including the Beta Tester group. They promote public participation and interaction without financial barriers.

### Decentralized Data Hosting

Participating companies can contribute to data hosting, enhancing the shard's reliability.

### Customization

Calimero offers customization for communities wanting their dedicated shards, ensuring each shard aligns with its community's requirements.

### Data Migration

Community shards facilitate easy data migration. Users can migrate data between shards with minimal disruptions, ensuring data continuity.
