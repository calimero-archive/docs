Event hooks service will receive all events from near-lake stream. It will then check defined webhooks and based on filters either call the destination service or not. Destination service is the user defined service whose url has a user set while creating a webhook. That service may have an open endpoint or require an auth token for access.
User can specify with a webhook authorization mechanism so the service can authorise incoming data.
