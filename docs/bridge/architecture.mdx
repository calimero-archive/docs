## Overview

The Calimero Bridge handles the transfer of various assets, including fungible and non-fungible tokens, between NEAR public networks (Testnet or Mainnet) and Calimero private shard. It also facilitates cross-shard contract calls, enabling interactions between public and private smart contracts.

Below is a high-level overview of the bridge's components:

## Key Components

The architecture of the NEAR to Calimero bridge includes the following key components:

### Light Client Contract

The Light Client Contract validates and accepts block headers that meet specific validation criteria, ensuring the integrity and security of the bridge's operations.

### Prover Contract

The Prover Contract provides verifiable proofs of events or actions that occurred on a specific chain, enhancing transparency and trust.

### Connector Contracts

The Connector Contracts handle the transfer of specific asset types:

- FT Connector: Facilitates the transfer of fungible tokens (FT) between NEAR and Calimero.
- NFT Connector: Handles the transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFT) between NEAR and Calimero.
- Cross-shard Contract Calls Connector: handles contract pair used to call one chain's contract methods from another chain.

### Archival Node
The Archival Node stores all past transactions, typically spanning a longer time period (e.g., a month or week ago). It serves as a historical record of transaction data.

### Indexer
The Indexer fetches blockchain data and stores it in a database, allowing for efficient retrieval and querying of transaction information.

### Validator
The Validator component communicates with the NEAR blockchain to validate transactions and maintain consensus across the network.

### Relayer
The Relayer is responsible for relaying information and transactions between NEAR and the Calimero private shard and vice versa, ensuring smooth communication and synchronization.

### Message Queue
The Message Queue facilitates the asynchronous communication and coordination of messages between different components of the bridge, ensuring reliable and scalable data processing.

### Bridge Service
The Bridge Service is a core component that manages the overall operation and coordination of the NEAR to Calimero bridge.
