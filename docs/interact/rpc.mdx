The RPC API allows you to communicate directly with the Calimwero network. The approach is the same as with NEAR RPC, but the RPC endpoint is different.


## [NEAR RPC - Quick Links](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction#near-rpc---quick-links)

## Example of using Calimero RPC API

POST https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/cali-calimero-testnet/neard-rpc/
Header: "Authorization: {auth_token}
Request
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "query",
  "params": {
    "request_type": "view_account",
    "finality": "final",
    "account_id": "cali.calimero.testnet"
  }
}
```

Response
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "amount": "9996499369999999999999999999900000",
        "block_hash": "GzBVoCkvAPAGaHGmTJcmRK6FrPJ716rsr3Zm1WSLMSTK",
        "block_height": 507347,
        "code_hash": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
        "locked": "0",
        "storage_paid_at": 0,
        "storage_usage": 182
    },
    "id": "dontcare"
}
```
