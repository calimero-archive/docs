Shard management is a key feature that allows users to manage various aspects related to a selected shard within a blockchain network. With Shard management, users can configure nodes, add accounts, and perform token transfers from custodial accounts (on the Calimero side, accounts for which we have stored keys) to public blockchain and other custodial account.

## Custodial account

In custodial accounts, on the Calimero side, we only display accounts for which the Calimero platform has stored keys. With your custodial account, you can create a key pair, add public keys and top up your tokens.

To access your custodial account, from the **Shard Management**, select **Custodial accounts**.

By default Calimero creates an custodial account for you but you can go ahead and create your own by clicking on **Add an account**.

:::info
Your custodial account ID is your shard_name + the suffix calimero.testnet (SHARDNAME.calimero.testnet)

### Top up account

Topping up the token balance allows users to add funds to their account and participate in transactions on the network.  To top up your account with tokens, you will need to follow these steps:

- Click on  **⋮** and select **Top up Account**
