In the explorer, you can quickly search for and analyze the specifics of your transaction, contract, block or account. The explorer dashboard offers a convenient way to monitor shard activity, track transactions, verify smart contract and examine the details of individual account.

## Account

Accounts store digital assets, maintain balances, and track transactions.

By clicking on any of the account ID, you'll be able to have an overview of:

- The number of transactions occured on that account
- The amount of storage used
- The native account balance currently on the account
- The amount of validator stake used
- The transactio hash details
- The total amount of fungible tokens the account has
-  The total amount of non fungible tokens the account has

## Blocks

The blocks serve as a record of transactions and other network activity. Each block in the private shard contains a unique cryptographic hash of the previous block in the chain, which creates a secure and tamper-proof record of all network activity. As new transactions are submitted to the network, they are validated by the network's validators and added to a new block in the chain. Once the block is validated, it is added to the private shard and becomes part of the network's transaction history.

By clicking on any of the blocks, you'll be able to have an overview of:

- The date the transactions occured
- The account author of transaction
- The status of the transaction
- The block and parent hash
- The transaction amount
- The receipt of the transaction
- The gas used for the transaction
