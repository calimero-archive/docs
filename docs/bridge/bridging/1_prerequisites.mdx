Before utilizing the bridge for token transfers and cross-shard calls, there are certain prerequisites that need to be fulfilled. Here are the necessary requirements:

1. **Running Calimero Shard**: Ensure that a Calimero shard is up and running. If you wish to set up your own Calimero shard, you can contact us via [email](mailto:info@calimero.network) or by filling out the [contact form](https://www.calimero.network/contact).

2. **Deployment of Contracts**: Deploy the required contracts on both the NEAR and Calimero chains. These contracts include the light client contract, prover contract, FT connectors, NFT connectors, and cross-shard call connectors.

3. **Relayers**: Run a relayer from NEAR to Calimero and another relayer from Calimero to NEAR. These relayers are responsible for relaying relevant blocks between the two chains.

4. **Bridge Service**: The bridge service should be running to monitor events in real-time on both NEAR and Calimero. It ensures the smooth operation of token transfers and cross-shard calls.

:::caution
When bridging tokens, it is **crucial** to possess the Account ID on the destination chain before initiating the bridge. Failure to do so may result in asset loss. Obtain the destination Account ID **prior** to the bridging process.
