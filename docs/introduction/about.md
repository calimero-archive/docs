# What is Calimero?

Calimero is a powerful and customizable sidechain built on top of the NEAR protocol. It functions as a network of networks, offering businesses a solution to access privacy features and enable scaling. With Calimero, you can leverage the benefits of NEAR while enjoying additional features and a strong focus on privacy. 

## Key Features of Calimero

1. **Customizable Private Shards**: Calimero allows you to create and manage your own private shards. A private shard is a separate and isolated subset of a larger blockchain network, which is accessible only to authorized participants who have been granted permission to join the shard. These shards are fully customizable and owned by you or your organization. Each shard has the potential to support up to 200,000 transactions per second, although a standard one shard deployment offers a throughput of 5,000 transactions per second. Calimero shards support three main modes of operation:

- Permissioned Private Calimero Shard: Owned by a single entity, this type of shard provides controlled access and ownership.

- Permissioned Private Calimero Shard by Consortium: Owned and governed by a consortium of entities, this shard allows for collaborative ownership and control.

- Public Calimero Shard: Owned and operated by a community, this shard fosters open participation and collaboration.

2. **Seamless communication between shards and networks**: Calimero enables seamless communication between your private shards, as well as with other networks. Even if different companies own the shards, they can still interact effectively.

## Who can benefit from Calimero's private shards?

Calimero's private shards cater to various user groups:

- **Traditional (web2) businesses**: Calimero provides an easy-to-use dashboard that serves as a gateway for web2 businesses to enter the web3 world. It offers a convenient way to manage private shards and access the benefits of blockchain technology.

- **Existing web3 businesses**: Businesses already operating in the web3 space can leverage Calimero's zero gas scaling and privacy features to enhance their operations.


## Use Cases

- **Interoperability with open-source protocols and applications**: Calimero allows you to enhance your application by interoperating with a wide range of protocols and applications, spanning from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

- **Seamless asset swapping**: You can effortlessly [wap assets](https://docs.calimero.network/bridge/bridging/prerequisites) between private chains and other public blockchains, ensuring fluidity and flexibility in managing your digital assets.

- **Cross-shard transactions**: Calimero enables [cross-shard](https://docs.calimero.network/bridge/bridging/cross_shard_calls)  transactions, empowering you to interact with third parties on the public chain or other permissioned enterprise shards.

- **Interacting with public blockchain applications**: Leveraging [Calimero SDKs](https://docs.calimero.network/calimero_sdk/installation), smart contracts deployed on private shards can interact with public blockchains (extended trust model, similar to Oracles), expanding the reach and capabilities of your application.

- **Encrypted channel for private shard interaction**: Calimero supports secure and encrypted channels for private shards to interact with each other, safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring privacy.


## Benefits of using private shards by Calimero network

Calimero’s private shards have all the benefits of NEAR in terms of high performance, security and sustainability. But as an important distinction, shards are not using NEAR’s validators, execution and state storage, but rather you’re using your own. The main benefits include:

1. **Scalability**: Calimero's private shards offer unlimited scalability, enabling businesses to handle increased transaction volumes and accommodate future growth. Enjoy the benefits of free transactions within your shard, supporting your business expansion.

2. **Security**: With private shards, you can make certain transactions or data accessible only to authorized parties, ensuring confidentiality and privacy. This controlled access allows you to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.

3. **EVM compatibility**: Private shards on Calimero are compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps). This compatibility saves time and resources by leveraging the existing Ethereum ecosystem.

4. **WASM compatibility & Javascript support**: Calimero supports WebAssembly (WASM) compatibility and JavaScript, making it easy for developers to onboard and leverage web3 technologies. You can quickly build and deploy applications on Calimero with familiar programming languages.

5. **Interoperability**: Calimero shards can communicate with the NEAR mainnet as well as with each other. Each shard can represent a different company or parts of the same company, facilitating collaboration and data sharing. The bridge technology enables the transfer of various assets, including fungible and non-fungible tokens.

6. **Customizable, performant and cost efficient**: Calimero private shards offer high-performance capabilities, supporting up to 200,000 transactions per second. Block times, contract sizes, and gas limits are customizable to fit your specific needs. Asset bridging and data calls are fast, taking only 5-10 seconds, and cost-effective, with minimal transaction fees.


## Which industries can Calimero be used in?

There are countless use cases, as only the imagination is the limit. To provide some inspiration, we’ve listed a couple different industries where private shards achieve their full potential.

- **Governments**: Think of banks implementing CBDC, or KYC & anti-money laundering use cases. The private data is stored on a shard, and can be available when needed, but is otherwise hidden from the public.

- **Fintech**: Digital assets and tokenization of financial assets, AML, KYC and digital identity, credit scoring, capital markets, trade finance, privacy solutions (for custody and treasury management).

- **Infrastructure**: For companies into energy, healthcare, insurance, real estate, telecommunications, supply chain… For example in the supply chain/transportation industry, you can use Calimero to verify data, keep track of the shipment across multiple companies (each with its own shard) and even buy/sell the goods while they’re still in transport.

- **Web3**: DAOs, DeFi, CeFi - think of all the operations within them, including orderbook, darkpools, treasury management and contributors payroll, Also in gaming, metaverse, entertainment, publishing (art, music, NFTs).

- **Gaming**: Example of using private shards in gaming: you start a chess game on the mainnet. You bridge the whole game to a private shard. On it, the game plays out for FREE and the moves are hidden (unless you want to reveal them). You bridge the outcome back to the mainnet. And voila!
