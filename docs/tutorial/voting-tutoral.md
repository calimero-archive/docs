In this video, we'll be deploying a voting smart contract Dapp on the Calimero Network.

## Prerequisite

To get started, ensure that you have the following:

- Set up your [Calimero private shard](https://docs.calimero.network/getting_started/set_shard)
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- The [Calimero examples repository](https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples) cloned onto your local machine
- The [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli#setup) tool installed
- Node and npm installed in your machine
- The [Rust and WASM](https://docs.near.org/develop/contracts/introduction#rust-and-wasm) toolchain installed

## Build smart contract

- Clone the [Calimero examples repository](https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples
```

- cd to the voting directory.

```bash
cd calimero-examples/voting
```

- Navigate to `contracts/private`
- Compile the Rust and WASM smart contract located using:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Compiled .wasm file of the contract located in :
`target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/poll.wasm`

## Generating an auth token

Before deploying the Voting smart dApp on our private shard, you must first generate a Calimero [auth token](/docs/getting_started/generate_token.md). This token will authenticate and authorize external applications to communicate with our shard.
To create an auth token, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Calimero Network account.
- Click on the **Security** dropdown in the left navigation menu.
- Select **Tokens**.
- Click on **Create new token**.
- Choose a name for your auth token.
- Select a duration for the token. For this demo, we will use a Perpetual token.
- Configure the token's permissions by selecting the appropriate checkboxes. In this case, we will select **Full access**.

![](../../static/img/voting_token.png)

:::tip
Make sure to store your token in a safe place, as it will be required to communicate with the private shard and cannot be obtained afterwards. For more information, see [Generate token](/docs/getting_started/generate_token.md).
:::

## Setting up the near CLI

To interact with Calimero shard using `near-cli`, you need to set the token value using **near set-api-key** command. 

- Set API key

```bash
 near set-api-key https://rpc.testnet.near.org <AUTH_TOKEN>   
```

Replace **<AUTH_TOKEN>** with your token value

:::note
The https://rpc.testnet.near.org value is currently ignored by the CLI. However, this issue is fixed and will be released in the next version of the CLI.
:::

- Create a new keypair for the shard main account (if your shard name is 'demos-calimero-testnet', your main account is 'demos.calimero.testnet').

```bash
 near generate-key SHARD_ID.calimero.testnet --networkId SHARD_ID-calimero-testnet
```

Replace **<SHARD_ID>** with your shard name

For our example this will be:

```bash
near generate-key demos.calimero.testnet --networkId demos-calimero-testnet
```

This command will create a keypair in the `~/.near-credentials/` folder.

- Go to the `~/.near-credentials/` folder to view the  keypair file which is usually in a `.json` format.

```bash
cd ~/.near-credentials/network-id/account-id.json
```

For our example, this will be:

```bash
cd ~/.near-credentials/network-id/demos-calimero-testnet
```

From the `.json` file, you'll see the account _id, private-key and public-key

## Link public key to console

From the `.json` file, you'll see the account _id, private-key and public-key. You'll need to copy the public key from the .json and link it to your account in the console.

- Open Calimero [Console](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard)
- Click on **Security**
- Click on **Custodial Accounts**
- Search for your custodian account ID in the list and click on the  `â‹®` three dots menu.
- Click on Add public key

## Create sub account

Next, we will create sub account which will be used to deploy the account that we have previously built. Run the following command:

 ```bash
near create-account <SUB_ACCOUNT_ID>.SHARD_ID.calimero.testnet --masterAccount SHARD_ID.calimero.testnet --networkId SHARD_ID-calimero-testnet--nodeUrl https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/SHARD_ID.calimero.testnet/neard-rpc/  
 ```

For our example, this will be

 ```bash
near create-account yt-voting-example-1.demos.calimero.testnet--masterAccount demos.calimero.testnet --networkId demos-calimero-testnet--nodeUrl https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/demos.calimero.testnet/neard-rpc/  
 ```

- Replace **<SUB_ACCOUNT_ID>** with your sub account name which can be anything for e.g yt-voting-example
- Replace **<SHARD_ID>** with your shard name

After, the command has ben ran, you can check in the **Custodial Accounts** section in your console to view the sub account you created.

## Deploy your NEAR contract

The next step, is to deploy this contract in the private shard. In your cloned repository, navigate to `deploy.calimero.sh`. We will be using the second command which is `near deploy`

```bash
near deploy \
  --accountId "" \
  --initFunction new --initArgs '{"question": "Which blockchain is best?", "options": ["NEAR","Bitcoin"]}' \
  --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/poll.wasm \
  --nodeUrl "calimero-rpc-node-url" \
  --networkId "$1-calimero-testnet"
```

- Replace the _accountID_ to your sub account name. In our example this will be  `yt-voting-example-1.demos.calimero.testnet`
- Replace _networkID_ to your shard name. In our example this will be `demos-calimero-testnet`
- For the `calimero-rpc-node-url`, go to the Calimero [Console dashboard](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard) and copy the the near RPC endpoint

For our example, this will be

```bash
near deploy \
  --accountId "yt-voting-example-1.demos.calimero.testne" \
  --initFunction new --initArgs '{"question": "Which blockchain is best?", "options": ["NEAR","Bitcoin"]}' \
  --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/poll.wasm \
  --nodeUrl "https://api.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/demos-calimero-testnet/neard-rpc/  " \
  --networkId "demos-calimero-testnet"
```

If the contract was successfully deployed you can check this on the [Explorer > Transactions](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard/explorer/transactions) on your the console.

## Updating config file and starting up DAPP frontend

To set up the frontend, you'll need to:

- Configure your connection settings in the `calimeroSdk.ts` file.

![](../../static/img/calimero.sdk.png)

:::info
We recommend using environment variables **.env** to save these settings. Here's a breakdown of what each configuration property does:
:::

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CALIMERO_URL**: this is an RPC endpoint used for syncing account and querying shard data and can be found on your Calimero Console dashboard page under endpoints table.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CALIMERO_TOKEN**: auth token created (use the token previously created from the console).


- Run the following command to start your http://localhost:3000 

```bash
$ yarn && yarn dev
```

- From your http://localhost:3000  click **Login with NEAR**

![](../../static/img/localhost.png)

- Connect your Shard

![](../../static/img/connect_shard.png)

- Click on **Connect**. You'll be redirected to a screen with the poll options

![](../../static/img/poll.png)

You can click on any of the options and also switch accounts to to click on the poll. Your result would be displayed immediately.

![](../../static/img/poll_options.png)

That's it, you now have an application that can access shard contracts.
