## What types of private shards are available on Calimero?
Currently, Calimero supports the Developer Shard, which is designed for developers to create and test applications on a private shard environment. More shard types, such as Professional Shard, will be available in the future.

## Why do I need an authentication token in Calimero?
An authentication token is required for secure communication with your Calimero private shard outside of the console. It serves as a unique code that verifies the identity of users and protects against unauthorized access. Auth tokens authenticate and authorize external applications to communicate with your shard, providing granular control over permissions and time to live.
