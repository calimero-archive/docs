Currently we only have support for Permissioned Private Calimero Shard owned by a single entity ran on Calimero Infrastructure. We are working on support Permissioned Private Calimero Shard owned by a consortium and Public Calimero Shard owned by a community which will be coming soon to the Calimero Network.
