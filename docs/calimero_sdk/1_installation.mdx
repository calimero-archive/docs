Calimero Private Shard are intergrated into the NEAR Wallet and users are able to authenticate via the NEAR Wallet.

We have built a demo example application which can be used as a tutorial for integration. The application can be found on https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-examples/tree/master/calimero-login and uses the Calimero Authentication SDK which is open-sourced: https://github.com/calimero-is-near/calimero-auth-sdk and published on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/calimero-auth-sdk.

Add the calimero-auth-sdk to you project by running:
```sh
yarn install calimero-sdk
```
or
```sh
npm install calimero-sdk
```
