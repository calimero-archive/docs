At this moment you are able to run the Private Shard only through our Calimero Dashboard. You can create an account on [https://alpha.app.calimero.network](ttps://alpha.app.calimero.network)  and start you first private shard. Currently we only have support for Permissioned Private Calimero Shard owned by a single entity ran on Calimero Infrastructure. 

We are working on support Permissioned Private Calimero Shard owned by a consortium and Public Calimero Shard owned by a community which will be coming soon to the Calimero Network.
