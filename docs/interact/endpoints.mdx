To interact with the private shard we provide two endpoints:

- Endpoint for interacting with the Calimero RPC Service
- Endpoint for interacting with the Calimero GraphQL Indexer Service

Both of the endpoints can be found on the [Calimero Dashboard](https://app.calimero.network/dashboard)

You should be able to copy these and integrate them into your application by using the NEAR SDKs or the CLI. 
To interact you will need to generate an Authorization token through the Dashboard or the NEAR Wallet Integration.

You can find more information about how to interact and integrate the endpoint into you applications in the following chapters.
