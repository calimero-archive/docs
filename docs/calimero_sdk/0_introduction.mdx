The NEAR API SDKs relates to Calimero SDK. The SDK enables the DApp to connect to a private shard through the NEAR wallet.

## Interacting with the SDK

To interact with the Calimero SDK, the DApp is developed using Next.js and relies on the Calimero SDK, which is a Node.js dependency available on npmjs. 

## Initialize the SDK

- To initialize the Calimero SDK, the authentication token obtained from the Calimero console is inputted, along with the RPC endpoint. 

- The DApp then invokes functions like `requestSignIn` or `requestSignTransaction`, which redirect users to the NEAR wallet for approval. 

- Upon approval of the requested action, such as sign-in, the connection to the Calimero shard is established.

For first-time sign-ins:

- The sync API is called within the Calimero console wallet API service. 

- The wallet API service communicates with the wallet API web service, which in turn executes calls to the RPC endpoint, creating the account associated with the sign-in. 

- Upon successful synchronization and sign-in, a function key is returned, enabling the DApp to access contract calls and other available functions through the walletConnection object from the `near-api-js` package.

The Calimero SDK integration process involves setting up and initializing the SDK, redirecting users to the NEAR wallet for approval, creating accounts through the sync API, and accessing contract calls and other functions through the walletConnection object. More information on how to install and get started with the SDK can be found [here](https://docs.calimero.network/calimero_sdk/installation)
