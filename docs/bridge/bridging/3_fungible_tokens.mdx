This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to bridge fungible tokens (FTs) from the NEAR Testnet to Calimero and withdraw them back to the NEAR Testnet. Please ensure that you have met the prerequisites mentioned in the previous section before proceeding.

## Bridging FTs from NEAR to Calimero

To bridge FTs from the NEAR Testnet to Calimero, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Lock Tokens on NEAR

Send the tokens to the `ft_connector` contract on NEAR Testnet in a single transaction that locks the tokens to the FT Connector contract.

### Step 2: Token Verification and Minting

The bridge service and relayer will verify the token locking on NEAR Testnet and mint wrapped tokens on the Calimero shard.

## Important Considerations

When bridging FTs from NEAR to Calimero, keep the following considerations in mind:

- Use the `ft_transfer_call` function instead of `ft_transfer` when locking FTs on the source side FT Connector. Using `ft_transfer` can result in the loss of tokens.

- Before withdrawing FTs from the destination side, ensure that the account performing the transfer is registered (storage deposit paid) on the original FT contract on the source side. If withdrawal is attempted before registration, the funds will be lost (locked on the connector on the source side). Contact the shard admin for assistance in such cases.

For a detailed, step-by-step guide on bridging FT tokens, refer to the [tutorial on how to bridge fungible tokens from NEAR to Calimero Shard](/docs/tutorial/bridging-ft-token.md). The tutorial provides comprehensive instructions and visual aids to help you successfully navigate the bridging process.

## Helper CLI

To interact with the Calimero side, you can create a Calimero alias using the following command:

```bash
alias calimero='function x() { near ${@:2} --nodeUrl https://api.dev.calimero.network/api/v1/shards/$1/neard-rpc --networkId $1;} ; x'
```

This alias allows you to use the `calimero` command in the terminal for interacting with the Calimero network.

## JavaScript Example

Here is a JavaScript snippet that demonstrates how to perform a token withdrawal on Calimero:

```javascript
const callWithdrawOnCalimero = {
  contractId: 'wrap.ft_deployer.cali99.calimero.testnet',
  methodName: 'withdraw',
  args: {
    amount: amount,
  },
  attachedDeposit: new BN('1'),
  gas: new BN(MAX_GAS_LIMIT),
};

const withdrawTokensTx = await senderAccount.functionCall(callWithdrawOnCalimero);
```

Feel free to customize the `contractId`, `methodName`, and `args` based on your specific requirements.
